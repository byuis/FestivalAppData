          "about": "George Washington (1732-99) was commander in chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War (1775-83) and served two terms as the first U.S. president, from 1789 to 1797. The son of a prosperous planter, Washington was raised in colonial Virginia. As a young man, he worked as a surveyor then fought in the French and Indian War (1754-63). During the American Revolution, he led the colonial forces to victory over the British and became a national hero. In 1787, he was elected president of the convention that wrote the U.S. Constitution. Two years later, Washington became Americas first president. Realizing that the way he handled the job would impact how future presidents approached the position, he handed down a legacy of strength, integrity and national purpose. Less than three years after leaving office, he died at his Virginia plantation, Mount Vernon, at age 67.",

            "about": "John Adams (1735-1826) thought of himself as born for strong times but not made for them, this could not be further from the reality which defined him as one of the strongest of men in a time which tried men's souls. As a graduate from Harvard University Adams was admitted to the bar and rose in reputation on both sides of the Atlantic, most notably for his successful defense of the British Soldiers charged in the Boston Massacre. Adams was a delegate to the First Continental Congress in 1774 and returned to serve in the Second Continental Congress in 1775. His unceasing effort in the Congress to drive the independency movement earned him the respect of every member of Congress. In the words of Thomas Jefferson who acknowledged his colleague Adams as \" our colossus on the floor.\" Adams though having never served in the military had a major working hand in the formation of three current branch's of military service, the Army, Navy and the Marine Corps. In addition to his outstanding work in Congress he would continue to serve his country as a diplomat. Most notably and perhaps ironically not only negotiating the Treaty of Paris to conclude the American War for Independence but as our first Ambassador to England. Upon his return from diplomatic service he would once again answer the call of his country serving as our first Vice President and then as the country's second President. But for all his accomplishments what would the life of this great man amount to without the partnership of his beloved Abigail? Abigail Adams provided her husband throughout his life a compass that brought him through the stormiest of seas. In truth both John and Abigail Adams were symbols of their time for both New England and America.",

Though he was nearly captured and hanged in his early missions, his information was passed on to General Washington. He can be seen, wandering, with a black armband.

          "about": "Sir John is a fictional character, however his backstory is historically based, i.e. the Redmayne family does exist and has a proud and storied military history in England dating back to the time of William the Conqueror in 1066. Major Redmayne's story would certainly be historically reflective of an actual officer that served the crown during the American Revolution. The 18th century British officer corps was essentially drawn from the upperclass and aristocratic element of British society. At this time there were no formal military training schools or academy's as we would know today, the 18th century officer learned by experience. Service on the North American continent is not new to the good Major, like two real British officer's of note, Thomas Gage and Sir William Howe who both saw action in the French and Indian War and as a result of such gained insight to the conduct of warfare in conditions very different than the European continent. Moreover, there were many British officer's notably General's Bourgoyne, Howe and Cornwallis were among many officers that had sympathy for the American cause and regarded the conflict as a civil war on their brethren. Here again, Sir John is of no exception, but he is a serving officer from a proud family with the privilege of holding a commission in the elite Coldstream regiment. His is the oldest of the three regiments that comprise the foot guards household division, the personal troops of none other than King George III. So as his sovereign commands, he will obey to serve over the hills and far away.",

              "description": "General Washington desperately needed reliable information about the British soldiers and their movements. Through the aid of Brigadier General Benjamin Tallmadge he established the Culper Spy ring. Through the perilous efforts of men and women such as Anna Strong, Robert Townsend, Caleb Brewster, Amos Underhill, and Samuel Culper, Sr., General Washington gained invaluable information that changed the course of the war. You can find Samuel Culper, Sr. by the black armband he wears on his left arm. He, and his other agents, can be at various locations through the park. To show you are a friend of liberty, ask if they will fish for cod in January. See their portraits below.",
