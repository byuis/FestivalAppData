As a graduate from Harvard University Adams was admitted to the bar and rose in reputation on both sides of the Atlantic, most notably for his successful defense of the British Soldiers charged in the Boston Massacre. Adams was a delegate to the First Continental Congress in 1774 and returned to serve in the Second Continental Congress in 1775. His unceasing effort in the Congress to drive the independency movement earned him the respect of every member of Congress. In the words of Thomas Jefferson who acknowledged his colleague Adams as \\\" our colossus on the floor.\\\" Adams though having never served in the military had a major working hand in the formation of three current branch's of military service, the Army, Navy and the Marine Corps. In addition to his outstanding work in Congress he would continue to serve his country as a diplomat. Most notably and perhaps ironically not only negotiating the Treaty of Paris to conclude the American War for Independence but as our first Ambassador to England. Upon his return from diplomatic service he would once again answer the call of his country serving as our first Vice President and then as the country's second President. But for all his accomplishments what would the life of this great man amount to without the partnership of his beloved Abigail? Abigail Adams provided her husband throughout his life a compass that brought him through the stormiest of seas.

Major Redmayne's story would certainly be historically reflective of an actual officer that served the crown during the American Revolution. The 18th century British officer corps was essentially drawn from the upperclass and aristocratic element of British society. At this time there were no formal military training schools or academy's as we would know today, the 18th century officer learned by experience. Service on the North American continent is not new to the good Major, like two real British officer's of note, Thomas Gage and Sir William Howe who both saw action in the French and Indian War and as a result of such gained insight to the conduct of warfare in conditions very different than the European continent. Moreover, there were many British officer's notably General's Bourgoyne, Howe and Cornwallis were among many officers that had sympathy for the American cause and regarded the conflict as a civil war on their brethren. Here again, Sir John is of no exception, but he is a serving officer from a proud family with the privilege of holding a commission in the elite Coldstream regiment. His is the oldest of the three regiments that comprise the foot guards household division, the personal troops of none other than King George III.
