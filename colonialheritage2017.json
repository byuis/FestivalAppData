During the American colonial period, barrels and casks played a major role in transporting goods of many varieties between England and the colonies. They were very durable and easily moved even when very heavily loaded. Oak barrels were vital to the creation and storage of the products of distillers like George Washington and brewers like Samuel Adams. The cooper was a skilled craftsman who worked both with wood and metal to create a watertight, durable container that was the heart of commercial trade both among the colonies and between the colonies and England.",

Although some basic tools were made in England and shipped to the colonies, it was much more common for wrought iron stock to be shipped, where it was made into a variety of tools and hardware by local blacksmiths. During the American colonial period, the blacksmith was often at the forefront of technological innovation. The blacksmith made nails, chain, and gate hardware; he repaired tools for farming and mended wagons; virtually all other craftsmen depended on the local blacksmith directly in one way or another. A young man learned the trade through an apprenticeship that began at around 14 years of age and lasted for seven years. In exchange for being taught the trade as well as how to read, write, and do basic mathematics, the apprentice worked for the master without pay.",

The son of a prosperous planter, Washington was raised in colonial Virginia. As a young man, he worked as a surveyor then fought in the French and Indian War (1754-63). During the American Revolution, he led the colonial forces to victory over the British and became a national hero. In 1787, he was elected president of the convention that wrote the U.S. Constitution. Two years later, Washington became Americas first president. Realizing that the way he handled the job would impact how future presidents approached the position, he handed down a legacy of strength, integrity and national purpose. Less than three years after leaving office, he died at his Virginia plantation, Mount Vernon, at age 67.",
