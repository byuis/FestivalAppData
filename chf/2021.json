The blacksmith made nails, chain, and gate hardware; he repaired tools for farming and mended wagons; virtually all other craftsmen depended on the local blacksmith directly in one way or another.

Households in the American Colonies commonly had locally made pottery as well as items made in Europe and the Orient. Most pottery made in the colonies was utilitarian in nature, such as chamber pots, butter pots, pans and other household and kitchen items. A few skilled potters immigrated to the Colonies from Europe and established businesses in larger cities. Outside of urban areas, there were few dedicated potters. It was common for farmers to engage in pottery making when other demands on their time allowed.","speakerNames":["Ron Chipman"],"tracks":[],"image":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/5f974013c6bdc971942ef008821e152c/570cc572/potter.png","icon":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/60ebf9d2c14acbab58efebb84c4c5421/0d0f832b/potter_100.png","id":8},{"name":"Mayflower","description":"The Mayflower first set sail on August 5, 1620- carrying 102 passengers, about half of which were \"Saints\" and the other half \"Strangers\".

This discovery captured the imagination of the western world and the profile images, so prominent in the Roman pottery, became a craze throughout Europe virtually overnight. The term \"Silhouette\" comes from penny-pinching French minister of finance, Etienne de Silhouette. During the French and Indian war, the economic outlook for France was so bleak that Silhouette introduced extreme measures of taxation and austerity. The name \"Silhouette became synonymous with \"cheap and because this form of portraiture was dramatically less expensive than the alternatives of the day (painted portraits and sculpture), a \"shadow portrait\" was called \"silhouette\" and the name stuck.","speakerNames":["Robert Kingsley"],"tracks":[],"image":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/7398c08ee7f10cb527df3e32854d9af5/04c7a5cd/silhouette_340.jpg","icon":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/8c6c51ae4467cf5ac601b5fa679d4f7c/38aef6c7/silhouette_100.jpg","id":10},{"name":"Stocks and Pillory","oneLiner":"Publick punishment for a polite populace","description":"Crimes and punishments of the Colonial times were meant to be fair, just, and of such a consequence that one would choose to choose differently the next time!

Initially its use in clothing was restricted to the clergy but it soon made its way into royalty fashion. By the time of the American Colonial period, lace was made throughout Europe. Each region had its own distinct style and many laws arose around it use. For example in England, it was against the law for anyone to wear French-made lace and English lace was only permitted to adorn the clothing of royalty, the clergy, and the aristocracy. In Colonial America, Englands lace laws were never enforced so anyone of means could wear it. However, because it takes about one hour to weave each square inch, it was never an affordable item.","speakerNames":["Marie Bassett"],"tracks":[],"image":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/32e7506ffd688d3696ce747ab4102d33/865b3ba1/lace_340.jpg","icon":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/cae89be6331a2dfe3d0a0655f829d0a8/e2030bf6/lace_100.jpg","id":13},{"name":"Geroge Washington's Camp","oneLiner":"A compete military encampment","tracks":[],"image":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4615ee217b08707f7dafafe5f753f127/172c3dff/camp_340.png","id":14},{"name":"Don Jolley Art","oneLiner":"Artwork of American History","speakerNames":["Don Jolley"],"tracks":[],"image":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/69db5bc829ac3248d36b96314a72ee22/d919fbea/jolley_340.jpg","icon":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/b7f0534769cf2662e1bf16e6c8a3e1db/6a833b35/jolley_100.jpg","id":15},{"name":"Wildwood Mercantile","oneLiner":"Retail store with 18th Century-type goods for sale","description":"Through most of the 18th century, the British colonists of North America looked to England for fashion and manufactured goods.

They were very durable and easily moved even when very heavily loaded. Oak barrels were vital to the creation and storage of the products of distillers like George Washington and brewers like Samuel Adams.

Virtually every society made some form of baskets and the materials used were extremely varied. During much of the colonial period there was a thriving basket-makers guild in England that sent baskets in large quantities to the colonies. These baskets were largely sold in cities while rural areas tended to rely on locally-produced baskets. The preferred material for baskets in much of the colonies was white oak. Trees no larger than six inches in diameter were felled and the trunks divided into long, flexible, weaving splits. These were allowed to dry for a few days and were made into baskets of a variety of shapes and sizes by both men and women as basketry requires more dexterity than strength.

Candles were made by repeatedly dipping a wick into molten wax and letting the wax cool. Each dipping added a new layer of wax and increased the size of the candle. This work was accomplished in a room referred to as a chandlery. Later, this term also referred to commercial establishments where candles were made or sold. In smaller households, the chandlers function did not require full time staff and was generally completed under the direction of the kitchen staff. By the late 1700s, many of the candles used in the American colonies were produced by commercial chandlers. Soap is a natural by-product of candle making, so many chandleries also sold soap. As both candles and soap were typical supplies for seagoing vessels, many chandleries in the American Colonies expanded to be general outfitters of ships.","tracks":[],"image":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/7d30ae80c149a1445da86a93475ae32e/2eedabca/cahndler_340.png","id":41},{"name":"Colonial Country Ball","oneLiner":"Colonial dance event open to the public","description":"Dancing was a favorite of all ages and social stations in the Georgian period.

During the American Revolution, he led the colonial forces to victory over the British and became a national hero. In 1787, he was elected president of the convention that wrote the U.S. Constitution. Two years later, Washington became Americas first president.

Major Redmayne's story would certainly be historically reflective of an actual officer that served the crown during the American Revolution. The 18th century British officer corps was essentially drawn from the upperclass and aristocratic element of British society. At this time there were no formal military training schools or academy's as we would know today, the 18th century officer learned by experience. Service on the North American continent is not new to the good Major, like two real British officer's of note, Thomas Gage and Sir William Howe who both saw action in the French and Indian War and as a result of such gained insight to the conduct of warfare in conditions very different than the European continent. Moreover, there were many British officer's notably General's Bourgoyne, Howe and Cornwallis were among many officers that had sympathy for the American cause and regarded the conflict as a civil war on their brethren. Here again, Sir John is of no exception, but he is a serving officer from a proud family with the privilege of holding a commission in the elite Coldstream regiment. His is the oldest of the three regiments that comprise the foot guards household division, the personal troops of none other than King George III.
